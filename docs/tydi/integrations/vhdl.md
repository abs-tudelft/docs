# Tydi in VHDL

While there is no direct, currently maintained, implementation of Tydi interfaces in VHDL, there are some previous tools that are relevant for creating an implementation in VHDL.

The [TIL -> VHDL](https://github.com/matthijsr/til-vhdl/) tool allows generating VHDL boilerplate code for Tydi interfaces from an interface description in the Tidy Intermediate Language (TIL). This can be used in conjunction with [V1 of Tydi-lang](https://github.com/twoentartian/tydi-lang) to write interfaces in Tydi-lang dialect instead.
